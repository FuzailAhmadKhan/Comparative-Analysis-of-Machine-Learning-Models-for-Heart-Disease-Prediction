# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Heart-Disease-Prediction
Developed a machine learning pipeline to compare five classification models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree) on a heart disease dataset. Used Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data processing, model evaluation, and visualization.
